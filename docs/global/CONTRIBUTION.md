If you plan to add some new features that involve large changes, it is encouraged to open an issue for discussion first.

**Issues**

2. choose one template to create an issue

**Pull Request**

1. fork and pull the latest GLOM repository
2. checkout a new branch (do not use the master branch for PRs)
3. commit your changes

Please describe your issue or PR as clear as possible. And use `NULL.` to fill blocks you don't know what to say instead of deleting them.
