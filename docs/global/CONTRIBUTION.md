## Contribute to EvalCSU
### [简体中文](CONTRIBUTION_zh_simplify.md) [繁體中文](CONTRIBUTION_zh_tradition.md)
All kinds of contributions are welcome, including but not limited to the following:

- fix typo or bugs of evaluations or projects
- add documentation like your note or mind map of a course or test, or translate the documentation into other languages
- add a project you made. It will be better if you provide it with the report of the project
- add your comments of a course, a teacher, or project

### Workflow

If you plan to add something that involves changes on a large scale, which might be to add new faculty, major, or note, you have to open an issue for discussion first.

**Issues**

1. click the New issue button on the Issues page
2. choose one template to create an issue

**Pull Request**

1. fork and pull the latest evalCSU repository
2. check out a new branch (do not use the master branch for PRs)
3. commit your changes
4. create a PR

Please describe your issue or PR as clear as possible. And use `NULL.` to fill blocks you don't know what to say instead of deleting them.
